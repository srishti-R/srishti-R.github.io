Since its a good practise to make a playground project for yourself to learn all the new features android has to offer I'll be maintaining this blog to write about all what I've learnt in making of [this](https://github.com/srishti-R/Playground_Project_for_Java) repo. <br/>
* Animation Drawables--> Make static 2 or 3 frames in any image graphic software (I used Inkscape), make a resource file under drawable folder naming it animation list and set a duration, and in OnCreate initialise and start animation.
