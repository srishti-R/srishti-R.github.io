title: Helpful links/references for android noobs
---
Caught in a web that is world wide, there is an onslaught of information if you go about searching a topic, especially 
tech blogs. Although most of them speak about a thing in almost the same manner, a few of these really stand out. For a 
beginner, I'll be jotting down all the links here that helped me come up the ladder everyday, bit-by-bit. Most of these 
will be no doubt stackoverflow links or medium articles. <br/>
* Splash-Screens in android: https://android.jlelse.eu/the-complete-android-splash-screen-guide-c7db82bce565
* Pending-Intents explanation: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808796/what-is-an-android-pendingintent"
* Room-database: I found [this]("https://medium.com/mindorks/using-room-database-android-jetpack-675a89a0e942") article useful
  although this article doesn't explain how to set up AppExecutors for querying room on background thread. Refer to my repos
  for the same.
* Room with live-data and view-Model:
