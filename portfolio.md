## Apps that I've made professionally including the logos.
### Tiyas: 
Worked with an NGO for developing an app that could send SMS to multiple people regarding their ward and different activities the school conducts from time to time. Its a private repo since the project included some confidential files
so if you are willing to look at the code, e-mail me I'll add you as a collaborator.
**Uses**: Android Architecture components- Room, LiveData and ViewModels.
## Apps that I've made personally (for fun) including the logos.
### NewsApp:
App that shows daily news fetching data from _The Guardian_ API, you can click on a news to read more, or share it with your friends. Detailed repo [here](https://github.com/srishti-R/NewsReportingApp) <br/>
