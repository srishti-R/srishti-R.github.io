## Apps that I've made professionally including the logos.
### Tiyas: 
Worked with an NGO for developing an app that could send SMS to multiple people regarding their ward and different activities the school conducts from time to time. Its a private repo since the project included some confidential files
so if you are willing to look at the code, e-mail me I'll add you as a collaborator.
**Uses**: Android Architecture components- Room, LiveData and ViewModels.<br/>

## Apps that I've made personally (for fun) including the logos.

### Retrofit+Picasso:
I made this project just for the purpose of learning retrofit, I dynamically queried NASA open API called APOD to display a picture captured by NASA for each day selected from a date-picker. Since retrofit returns a url I used Picasso library to load images. In this app, you can select the day to see that day's picture. Detailed code [here.]("https://github.com/srishti-R/Retrofit_example") <br/>
