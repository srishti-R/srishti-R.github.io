## Apps that I've made professionally including the logos.
### Tiyas: 
Worked with an NGO for developing an app that could send SMS to multiple people regarding their ward and different activities the school conducts from time to time. Its a private repo since the project included some confidential files
so if you are willing to look at the code, e-mail me I'll add you as a collaborator.
**Uses**: Android Architecture components- Room, LiveData and ViewModels.<br/>
